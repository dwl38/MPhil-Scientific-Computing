# Written Assignment 2: "Fine-tuning foundation models with MACE"

The goal of this written assignment was to "utilise machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for the fine-tuning of foundation models, specifically using the MACE architecture, [...] and to explore the advantages of fine-tuning, such as improved accuracy, reduced computational costs for training, and the effective use of smaller datasets."

This written assignment was mostly based on the following papers:

- I. Batatia et al. (2023). A foundation model for atomistic materials chemistry. arXiv preprint, 2401.00096.
- H. Kaur et al. (2025). Data-efficient fine-tuning of foundational models for first-principles quality sublimation enthalpies. Faraday Discuss., vol. 256, pg. 120--138, DOI:[10.1039/D4FD00107A](https://doi.org/10.1039/D4FD00107A).

A small collection of example datasets was also provided to students to select from.
