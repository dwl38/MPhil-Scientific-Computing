# MPhil-Scientific-Computing
A repository for my various work submissions for the MPhil in Scientific Computing[^1], containing the code and written reports for:

- **<ins>Written assignment 1</ins>.** A short assignment, intended to replicate a research task, on the application of a [MACE](https://github.com/acesuit/mace) foundation model on a system of choice;

- **<ins>Written assignment 2</ins>.** A short assignment, intended to replicate a research task, on the efficiency of fine-tuning a foundation model compared to training from scratch;

- **<ins>Project</ins>.** A major original research project on a topic of choice.

Each submission can be found in their corresponding directory (`WA-1` and `WA-2` for written assignments 1 and 2 respectively, and `Project` for the project), and each directory has its own README explaining the specifics.
